# Defect Detection

This repository contains the full analysis for the defect detection model assessment

The primary goal is to determine an optimal confidence threshold for the model and provide concrete, data-driven recommendations for future improvement.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **/data**: Contains the raw and processed data files.

  - `anno_df.csv`: The ground truth dataset with manual annotations.
  - `pred_df.csv`: The raw predictions generated by the AI model.
  - `matched_df.csv`: An intermediate CSV generated during the analysis, containing predictions matched to ground truth annotations.

- **/notebooks**: Contains the main analysis notebook.

  - `Defect_Detection_Assessment.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the complete, end-to-end analysis, including data exploration, visualization, IoU matching, threshold analysis, and final recommendations.

- **/scripts**: Contains modular Python scripts that encapsulate the core logic of the analysis. The notebook imports and uses these scripts.

  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for loading and cleaning the initial datasets.
  - `image_matching.py`: The core logic for matching predictions to ground truth annotations using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric.
  - `confidence_thresholds.py`: Functions to calculate performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) and determine the optimal threshold.

- `requirements.txt`: A list of the necessary Python libraries to run the analysis.

## How to Run the Analysis

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Heban-7/defect-detection
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    The entire analysis and narrative can be viewed and executed by running the `notebooks/Defect_Detection_Assessment.ipynb` file. This notebook serves as the main report and provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the project.
